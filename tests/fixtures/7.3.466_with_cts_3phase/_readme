7.3.466_with_cts_3phase

UPDATE1:

/production.json endpoint only provides phase details when passing parameter details=1

so /production file has phases removed while /production.json file has them included.

ORIGINAL:

Somewhere between fw 7.3.466 and 7.6.175 /production endpoint stopped reporting phase data
for Envoy metered with CT and multi-phase (Split or Three).

The (original) test fixture 7.6.175_with_cts_3phase includeded a /production endpoint file with phases included.

This fixture set is build from a debug log for a 7.3.466 FW with elements from the original 7.6.175 added.

Verified from a 7.3.466 debug log:

- api_v1_production
- api_v1_production_inverters
- ivp_ensemble_inventory
- ivp_meters_readings
- ivp_meters_reports
- production
- production.json
