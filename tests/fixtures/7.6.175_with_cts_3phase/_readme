7.6.175_with_cts_3phase

UPDATE1:

/production.json endpoint only provides phase details when passing parameter details=1

so /production file has phases removed while /production.json file has them included.


ORIGINAL:

Somewhere between fw 7.3.466 and 7.6.175 /production endpoint stopped reporting phase data
for Envoy metered with CT and multi-phase (Split or Three).

The original test fixture 7.6.175_with_cts_3phase includeded a /production endpoint file with phases included.

To reflect actual firmware behavior the production and production.json files are updated to the pattern
without phase details (lines:) as verified by ones from a diagnostics and debug log file for a 7.6.175 fw.

Verified with 7.6.175 diagnostics:

- admin_lib_tariff
- api_v1_production_inverters
- ivp_ensemble_inventory
- ivp_meters
- ivp_meters_readings
- production
