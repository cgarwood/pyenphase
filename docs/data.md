# Data

The pyenphase package collects [data](#pyenphase.EnvoyData) from a specific set of endpoints on the Envoy. The set is based on the home owner [authorization level](./usage_authentication.md#authorized-levels) as common denominator. Additional endpoints [can be obtained](./advanced.md#bring-your-own-endpoint), but require application logic.
